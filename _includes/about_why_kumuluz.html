						A standard approach for deploying Java EE applications is packing all components into a single EAR/WAR archive and deploying the archive on the application server.
					</p>
					<p>
						This leads to monolithic architectures which make applications difficult to maintain and scale in cloud (PaaS) environments.
					</p>
					<p>
						The microservice architecture addresses these shortcomings by decomposing an application into a set of stateless microservices. Each microservice has a well-defined functionality and an interface for communication with other services.

						Microservices also have their drawbacks. To deploy them on standalone containers requires several steps, from configuring the containers, defining the dependencies, deploying the services, etc.
					</p>
					<p>
						As such Java EE developers currently do not have a framework, which would allow them to simplify and automate the deployment and configuration, required for microservice architecture.
						The framework is completely modular and as such allows you, with the help of Maven, Gradle or plain old jar files, to handpick the components that you need for your application.

						Whether it be only JAX-RS and JPA or a bigger stack with EJB, JAX-WS, JSF, JMS and many more. Underneath it all is an embedded light-weight high performance HTTP and servlet web server of your choice.
