Such a design also enables us to simply drop in a replacement for an existing microservice without reprogramming all the others.",

                                <p>
                                    The industry standard approach for deploying Java EE applications is packing all
                                    components into single EAR/WAR archive and deploying the archive on an application
                                    server. Although this approach has several advantages, particularly from the
                                    ease-of-development perspective, it leads to monolithic architecture, makes
                                    applications difficult to maintain, and - particularly important - makes such
                                    applications more difficult and sometimes impossible to scale to meet today’s
                                    real world demands, especially in PaaS (cloud) environments.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Microservice architecture addresses these shortcomings by decomposing an application
                                    into a set of microservices. Each microservice has well-defined functionalities
                                    and an interface to communicate with other microservices (such as REST, WSDL, or
                                    if needed even RMI). Most often, microservices are stateless.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Instead of packing all microservices into a single archive (EAR/WAR), each
                                    microservice is developed and deployed independently of each other. This brings
                                    several advantages, such as:
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Microservice approach also has its drawbacks, particularly in the added complexity,
                                    related to development and particularly to the deployment. To deploy microservices
                                    on
                                    stand-alone containers requires several steps, such as configuring the containers,
                                    defining the dependencies, deploying the microservices, etc.
                                </p>

                                    Enter KumuluzEE, a framework that automates the tasks, related to the deployment and
                                    configuration of Java EE applications following the microservice pattern and makes
                                    it
                                    seamless. We will showcase how you can use KumuluzEE to create microservices using
                                    standard Java EE APIs that run in every Java environment as any other Java
                                    application
                                    with little to no extra configuration thus eliminating the need for an application
                                    server.

                                <h2>Getting started</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Let’s get started! First let’s examine what KumuluzEE provides and how we can start
                                    using it to build our microservices. The main benefit is that we don’t actually have
                                    to learn “yet another framework”. KumuluzEE uses the standard Java EE specifications
                                    and components that many developers and DevOps including us are very familiar with.
                                    In fact if you use the default configuration (which is perfectly fine for most
                                    cases)
                                    and control your settings with environment variables that you as well as KumuluzEE
                                    defines, you don’t have to write anything extra at all. You get the microservice
                                    benefits “for free”.
                                </p>
                                <p className="indented">
                                    You can write your microservices the same way you write your Java EE applications,
                                    using the same tools you always use. The framework will take care of bootstrapping
                                    all the required components to make your application run.
                                </p>

                                    The result are small standalone (and preferably stateless) microservices that can
                                    run
                                    anywhere (remember “Write once, run anywhere”) using technologies that used to
                                    require
                                    full blown heavyweight application servers.

                                    Using KumuluzEE we can easily break down existing monolithic applications into
                                    microservices and start deploying them to the cloud. Since microservices with
                                    KumuluzEE are basically regular Java applications, they can run in virtually
                                    every cloud platform available or otherwise, thus offering an excellent middle
                                    ground between modern patterns/models and existing enterprise technologies.

                                    KumuluzEE comes with support for several Java EE specifications that we can
                                    selectively use in our microservices. As of this writing KumuluzEE comes
                                    with the following technologies:

                                    You can selectively choose to include only those that you actually need. This means
                                    that you can select only the dependencies and components that you use, instead of
                                    always having the entire runtime present that’s using your memory and slowing your
                                    microservice down, as well as allow each and every microservice you create to have
                                    its
                                    own tailored runtime.

                                    For certain components you can also choose which implementation you would like to
                                    include, in case you prefer one or the other. The component list and their

                                    microservices that will be packaged and deployed independently to a scalable cloud
                                    platform.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Let’s take KumuluzEE for a spin and see it in action. Let’s start with an example.
                                    Supposed we would like to create an online book catalogue that people can browse and
                                    place orders for the books they like. While there would normally be many more
                                    functionalities, of course, for brevity we are only going to look at the two of
                                    them;
                                    browsing available books and placing orders. Our goal will be to create an
                                    application
                                    with the following requirements:
                                </p>
                                {this.renderCheckBoxes(buildingMicroservicesCheckboxes)}
                                <p>
                                    With traditional application servers we would normally create a monolithic EAR
                                    package
                                    that would include our business logic and several WAR packages. Our architecture
                                    would
                                    look something like this:
                                </p>
                                <div className="image-section">
                                    <img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1c8302327ca43d7f0edb80c3517c8b93ff2d9251/1446f/assets/images/posts/microservices-with-java-ee-and-kumuluzee-updated/monolithic.png" alt="monolithic"/>
                                </div>
                                <p>
                                    We would have several beans deployed that would handle all the business logic, those
                                    would use a JPA or some other database module that would handle access to an
                                    underlying database and optionally as act as our ORM. We would then expose our app
                                    to the world with a series of REST APIs. These would then go on to call our business
                                    logic. To show the actual content we would use a static HTML5 JavaScript web app,
                                    written in any of the multiple (and growing) modern JS frameworks available today.
                                    They would then go on to call our REST API to access all the functionality. All the
                                    components would be packaged together into a single EAR and deployed to the
                                    application server.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    At first this may seem as a perfectly good design. However we can quickly start to
                                    identify its shortcomings. When our application starts to grow and we get more and
                                    more traffic, we need to start scaling out. We can start to scale up, however that
                                    can
                                    only get us so far. Sooner rather than later we need to start distributing our
                                    requests. The way we do that is to set up, configure and maintain a cluster of
                                    application servers which is usually - let’s face it - a not so pleasant experience.
                                    And since virtually no cloud provider offers support for such configurations we are
                                    basically on our own. Even if we do manage set it all up somewhat efficiently, we
                                    still have no real simple way to provide true elasticity and scalability to
                                    our application.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Let’s dig into some more problems:
                                </p>
                                {this.renderCheckBoxes(problemsCheckboxes)}
                                <p>
                                    Many of these issues don’t have a straightforward solution using the
                                    traditional monolithic approach.
                                </p>
                                <h3>How can KumuluzEE solve these problems</h3>
                                <p>
                                    So let’s try the microservice approach and refactor our architecture to follow the
                                    microservice architectural pattern while continuing to use standard Java EE
                                    technologies. To achieve this, we are going to use the KumuluzEE framework:
                                </p>
                                <div className="image-section" style={{marginBottom: "20px"}}>
                                    <img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d3b00da4c82ae95f375fdc512ea766a91460d508/36fcb/assets/images/posts/microservices-with-java-ee-and-kumuluzee-updated/microservice.png" alt="microservice"/>
                                </div>
                                <p>
                                    We start by separating our concerns and split the catalogue and orders
                                    functionalities
                                    into two separately configured and deployed microservices. That way we have created
                                    microservices that are only concerned with their respected functionalities. We’ve
                                    also reduced the interference with one another and overall form a better modular and
                                    bug free application. Each one of them will communicate with each other through
                                    pre-defined REST interfaces.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If we look at the problems we listed we can see that now with microservices we have
                                    a straightforward solution for each and every one of them:
                                </p>
                                {this.renderCheckBoxes(solutionsCheckboxes)}
                                <p>
                                    We do however need to make sure that the microservices are stateless in nature as
                                    specific instances can be destroyed, started or moved at any time. Every resource
                                    that a microservice uses should be an external one that we can configure via the
                                    environment. For instance; PostgreSQL as a database, RabbitMQ as a messaging
                                    service,
                                    Redis as a cache provider and S3 or Swift as file storage.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    However, this kind of approach does not come without its drawbacks. Setting up and
                                    configuring Java EE projects to accompany this kind of architecture may not
                                    be so trivial.
                                </p>
                                <p className="indented">
                                    We would also like to avoid using an application server instance for every
                                    microservice to reduce overhead and simplify configuration. This is where KumuluzEE
                                    comes in; it makes deployment and configuration seamless.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Now that we know what we want to do, let’s write our microservices (finally)!
                                </p>
                                <h2>Maven</h2>
                                <p>
                                    We will create two projects, each one will contain its own microservice. To
                                    simplify we will create both projects in the same repository. In real-world projects
                                    it is recommended to have a separate repository (git or otherwise) for each
                                    microservice so that they are treated as separate entities and have separate
                                    versioning and revision history as well as deployment.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We will be using Maven to create the application as that is our system of choice and
                                    currently the only build system supported.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Our project structure will look like this:
                                </p>
                                {/*project structure*/}
                                <p>
                                    Again this is only to simplify the example. In a real project the
                                    <span className="inline-code">catalogue</span> and <span
                                        className="inline-code">orders</span>
                                    folders/projects would each be in a separate repository. We have also added a
                                    module that will hold our JPA entities as they will be shared with our two
                                    microservices, again, to simplify the example. First let’s create the top-most
                                    <span className="inline-code">pom.xml</span> that will only serve in this example to
                                    include our main modules. We will be using <span
                                        className="inline-code">acme.com</span>
                                    as our package name and group id throughout the examples, however the&#160;

                                <h2>Add KumuluzEE</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Now we need to add the appropriate dependencies. As mentioned the framework is
                                    completely modular which means that apart from the core functionality every Java EE
                                    component is packaged as a separate module and must be included explicitly as a
                                    dependency in order to use it. KumuluzEE will automatically detect which modules
                                    are included and properly configure and enable them.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    All modules are versioned and released together, which helps reducing cross version
                                    conflicts and bugs. You can define a property with the current version of KumuluzEE
                                    to use it with every dependency or import the KumuluzEE BOM module, which will
                                    include
                                    the correct module dependency definitions in your project. In this sample we will
                                    use
                                    the latter.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    NOTE: Use the same version for every module as not doing so might result in
                                    unexpected
                                    behavior.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We will import the BOM to our parent <span className="inline-code">pom.xml</span>,
                                    which includes all of KumuluzEE’ dependency definitions. This will allow us to
                                    include
                                    any KumuluzEE module without specifing its version.
                                </p>

                                    This is the bare minimum required to run a microservice with plain servlets and
                                    static
                                    files. Let’s try it out! KumuluzEE will use a <span
                                        className="inline-code">webapp</span>
                                    folder at the root of your <span className="inline-code">resource</span> folder to
                                    look for files and configuration regarding it. This is the only difference to the
                                    standard Java EE file structure as the <span className="inline-code">webapp</span>
                                    folder has to be inside the <span className="inline-code">resource</span> folder,
                                    not
                                    alongside it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We don’t need to include a web.xml file, because KumuluzEE supports annotation
                                    scanning as per the specification. However, when and if you need it, you can simply
                                    add it and it will be automatically detected and used.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Let’s add a simple HTML file.
                                </p>

                                    And this is all you need to do. The <span
                                        className="inline-code">kumuluzee-core</span>
                                    package provides the class <span
                                        className="inline-code">com.kumuluz.ee.EeApplication</span>
                                    with a main method that will bootstrap your app. If you have your project opened in
                                    an
                                    IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, …), you can now start the microservice creating a new run
                                    configuration, selecting <span className="inline-code">Java application</span> and
                                    enter the above class as the <span
                                        className="inline-code">Main class</span> attribute.
                                    If however you are looking to run it from the terminal (as will be the case on a
                                    server and various PaaS environments), then you run it directly from the class files
                                    in the target directory.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    NOTE: If you forget to add the <span className="inline-code">webapp</span> folder or
                                    accidentally misplace it, KumuluzEE will warn you with very descriptive messages.

                                    To do so, you must include the <span

                                    to your <span className="inline-code">pom.xml</span> file, which will copy all your

                                    KumuluzEE does for you. You add the required dependencies and start developing
                                    standard Java EE applications.

                                    We’ll continue and add the remaining required dependencies. We will need JAX-RS for
                                    the
                                    REST interfaces (JPA will be included in the <span
                                        className="inline-code">models</span>
                                    module). For simplicity, we will add CDI as well, as it comes with as it comes with
                                    full support for resource injecting (e.g. <span
                                        className="inline-code">EntityManager</span>
                                    injection using <span className="inline-code">@PersistenceContext</span>). However,
                                    we could just as well do without it to keep our microservice even lighter. For all
                                    the components we will add, we will use their reference implementations. However you
                                    are free to chose any other ones (e.g. Hibernate for JPA) that are supported. They
                                    will function identically with regards to the Java EE specification and APIs.

                                    to fully customize your microservice, KumuluzEE also comes with a number of

                                    profiles that contain the more popular combinations of components. Including, as of
                                    version 2.1.1, the <span className="inline-code">microProfile-1.0</span> profile
                                    with

                                <h3>JPA module</h3>
                                <p>
                                    In the JPA module we will add our <span
                                        className="inline-code">persistence.xml</span>
                                    and entity classes that will be shared with both our microservices even though they
                                    will be ran separately. In the example we will use a PostgreSQL database. However,
                                    you
                                    are free to use any database JPA and Java supports. Just add the driver as a
                                    dependency.

                                    You can quickly notice we are not using JTA transaction and datasources in our
                                    JPA module. We have opted out of using JTA in this example in order to keep the
                                    microservice as light as possible as we will only have a single external resource
                                    (DB) and as such have no real need for it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Configuration of the datasources and other preferences is handled with the KumuluzEE
                                    config extension, as this particular part is not handled by any Java EE
                                    specification.
                                    In short, everything in KumuluzEE (including your own settings) is configured
                                    through
                                    the main <span className="inline-code">config.yaml</span> file located at the root
                                    of
                                    the resources folder. Every value inside it can be overwriten with environemnt
                                    variables or system properties as well as any additional config sources you add
                                    (e.g. etcd and similar). A detailed overview of the framework will be described
                                    in following blog posts.

                                    Every value defined in the yaml file can be overwritten by setting the approriate
                                    environment variable. For example, if we want to override the datasource password we
                                    can set the environemnt variable <span
                                        className="inline-code">KUMULUZEE_DATASOURCES[0]_PASSWORD</span>
                                    before we start our microservice. We can quickly see a pattern how we can access and
                                    override any variable in the config file.

                                    Now let’s implement the orders module. We’ll create an order resource that will
                                    contain
                                    two methods; <span className="inline-code">placeOrder(Book)</span> and
                                    <span className="inline-code">getOrder()</span>. We need to add the correct
                                    dependencies, a JAX-RS application and a JAX-RS resource. For this microservice we
                                    will add the MicroProfile 1.0 profile, which coincidentally, includes the exact
                                    correct components we need.

                                    root of your orders resource directory. You may also need to add a file inside the
                                    directory for certain tools to include the folder. In any case you should get
                                    very descriptive error messages.

                                    this case the URL to the catalogue service, so we can correctly query the book
                                    details using its identification number. For now we will use a static value, you can
                                    take a look at the full example on GitHub to see how to integrate with the
                                    KumuluzEE config extension.

                                    As you can see the microservice is exactly the same as any other Java EE app. We
                                    opted out of using JTA which means we have to manually manage transactions. In such
                                    cases we don’t believe that that is in and of itself a bad thing. Sometimes a bit
                                    more transparency may be a good thing.
                                </p>

                                    In our <span className="inline-code">placeOrder(Book)</span> method you can see an
                                    example of communicating with our other microservice via the REST APIs and not
                                    directly in code. This way we successfully decoupled our microservices from one
                                    another.
                                </p>

                                    A microservice can and should contain multiple REST resources. To put it
                                    differently;
                                    it should contain as many REST resources as it needs to perform the functions it
                                    is designed to do.

                                    We can also notice that we are injecting our <span

                                    with the <span className="inline-code">@PersistenceContext</span> annotation. Since
                                    we
                                    have included CDI to our microservice this will work as expected. We do however need
                                    to
                                    make sure that we have included the <span
                                        className="inline-code">beans.xml</span> file
                                    in our <span className="inline-code">META-INF</span> directory. That way we tell CDI
                                    to enable injection in this module.

                                <p>
                                    And we’re done. We have just created two microservices that will run independently
                                    of
                                    each other. However they can still work together with the help of REST interfaces
                                    and
                                    of course share common resources like a database. We can now build and run them
                                    independently. Because we will be starting two HTTP servers, we must use a different
                                    port for the other server. We can easily control this using the
                                    <span className="inline-code">PORT</span> environment variable.

                                    We have shown how KumuluzEE can help you create microservices using standard Java EE
                                    specification and APIs. With KumuluzEE we are able to bridge the gap between Java EE
                                    and the microservice architecture and focus solely on developing with what we
                                    already
                                    know but in a completely new way. KumuluzEE seamlessly sets everything up
                                    automatically
                                    so it just works, while still allowing a great deal of customisation to accommodate
                                    our needs. On top of that it makes it easy to run our microservices. This opens a
                                    world of possible cloud configurations with almost any cloud provider out there that
                                    are simply not possible now. It also provides all the other benefits of
                                    microservices,
                                    including more flexible architecture, easier maintenance, better scalability, etc.
                                    without the added configuration overhead.

                                    In this tutorial, we have described the basic steps for developing a microservice.
                                    Microservice architecture, or more generally, cloud-native architecture opens
                                    several
                                    new perspectives, related to microservice configuration, logging, discovery,
                                    circuit-breakers, metrics, security, event streaming and more. KumuluzEE provides
                                    extensions, which address these topics. The KumuluzEE framework already provides
                                    support for configuring microservices using environment variables or property files
                                    or YAML files. KumuluzEE extensions provide even broader functionalities, not only
                                    for
                                    configuration, but also for logging, discovery, circuit-breakers, metrics, security,
                                    event streaming and more. We don’t cover them here as each one would need a separate
                                    blog post to properly describe. For now you can find them on our home page or on the
                                    GitHub page and look out for future blog posts covering them soon.
