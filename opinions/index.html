					Although Java EE specifications and application servers have come down in size, it still wasn't a first technology choice for today's micro services developer when compared to say NodeJS or Spring Boot. That's now changed as KumuluzEE brings a light-weight, application server free way of creating micro services with the full power of Java, the JVM and JavaEE behind it! This innovative stack is truly a worthy Duke Awards winner in 2015.
